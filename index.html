  <h2>Solve times by day of week, over time</h2>
  <p>The x-axis represents the date I solved the puzzle, not necessarily the date of the puzzle. As time moves on and I get more experience solving, I would hope that my solving time gets better!
  <div id="timesByDay" style="width:90%;height:90%;"></div>

  <h2>Puzzle start time</h2>
  <p>What time of day did I first start solving the puzzle? Again, the x-axis represents the solve date.
  <div id="timeOfDay" style="width:90%;height:90%;"></div>

  <h2>Time between start and end by date and time of day</h2>
  <p>The difference between when I first opened the puzzle and when I solved it. This differs from solve time in that I may have closed the puzzle and come back to it later. 
  <div id="solveLength" style="width:90%;height:90%;"></div>
